# Lucas Kanade Algorithm for Optical Flow

This project implements Lucas Kanade algorithm for measuring optical flow.

Steps to run the program -
1. The program uses command line execution
2. Format - python OpticalFlow.py <folder-name>
3. In order to convert frames to videos and videos to frame use the respective scripts.
4. To use the algoritm, make sure the images are in '.pgm' format.
